"""Blackwell (sm_120) compatibility shim for ``xformers.ops.memory_efficient_attention``.

xformers ships no fused kernel that accepts this GPU: ``cutlassF`` and ``fa3F``
both refuse capability (12, 0), and ``fa2F`` caps head_dim at 256 while Stable
Diffusion's VAE self-attention uses 512. Every backend therefore fails to
dispatch and xformers raises ``NotImplementedError``.

``XFORMERS_DISABLED=1`` fixes DINOv2 (it checks the env var itself) but not the
DenseMatcher stack: ``ldm`` and ``odise`` decide at *import* time via a bare
``import xformers`` and then call ``memory_efficient_attention`` directly, so
there is no env var or config to turn it off.

Replacing the function with a ``F.scaled_dot_product_attention`` equivalent
covers every call site at once, whichever module made the decision. PyTorch's
SDPA computes the same thing — it just picks a kernel that supports this GPU —
so features are unchanged, at some memory cost. This mirrors the ``flash_attn``
stub the CoSMo3D encoder installs for the same class of problem.
